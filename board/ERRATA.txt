Board Initial Revision Errata - February 11, 2018
=================================================

MOSI is connected to U5 pin 7, which is open-drain and not usable as a serial
output. The latest code has reassigned MOSI to U5 pin 14.

1. Cut the middle of the five traces between U5 and U6.
2. Solder a jumper wire from U5 pin 14 to U6 pin 2.



LATCH needs a pullup resistor.

1. Solder a 1.6k resistor to U6 pin 20.
2. Solder a jumper wire from the other end of the resistor to U1 pin 4.



The display board is 0.1" wider than the control board.



The mounting holes on the display board are unused.
